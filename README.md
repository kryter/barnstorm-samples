Samples of end to end tests using Barnstorm

## Explore Barnstorm Structure

We will start with sample test provided by the awesome folks at Cypress.io in `cypress/integration/todoSpec.ts`.  This is the default sample test that you will see when running `cypress:open` in a project where the `cypress` folder has not yet been created.

We've copied this test into `cypress/integration/todoSpecWithBarnstorm.ts` and we will convert it to use Barnstorm structure.
